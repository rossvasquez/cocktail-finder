# Cocktail Finder

This application uses reactpress, a wordpress plugin that allows you to add react apps to your site. You create a react app in a localwp directory, build it, then deploy that version of your wp site. I used Vite to create the react app and TailwindCSS for styling. Hits a random coktail API that returns data necessary for the recipe card.
